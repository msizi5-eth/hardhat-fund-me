We added the plugin 'hardhat-deploy'.

This plugin is used to streamline the deployment process.
In addition to the plugin, we added this folder because
whenever 'deploy' is called in the terminal, it will check
the files in this folder.

A good practice is to number them. That'll ensure that the
scripts are run in the order you want them to run.
